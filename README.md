# # George Kacoyanis | Data Analyst & Data Science Enthusiast

Welcome to my portfolio!  
This site showcases my background, projects, and professional interests in **data analytics, machine learning, and business intelligence**.

## About Me

  I'm an analytical thinker with a goal to use data science and analytics tools to create insights and optimize strategies. Currently use my math skills to train AI to improve it's Math reasoning abilities. 

## üìöEducation
**Florida State University**
  
  Bachelor's of Science in Statistics - Graduated May 2023

**Florida Gulf Coast University**
  
  Master's of Business Administration Concentrated in Data Analytics - Graduated May 2025

## üìÅProjects Featured

- **Machine Learning Data Exploration in Excel**  
  Exploratory data analysis for the Boston Housing Area to find the drivers in Median Value of Owner-Occupied Homes, using Frontline Data Solver in Excel to conduct these methods: Principle Componenet Analysis, Correlation Analysis, Regression analysis (Multi-Variate Linear and Logisitc), Regression and Classification Trees, Random Trees, Neural Networks, K-Nearest Neighbors Means Clustering, and boosting/bagging classification and regression ensembles.

- **ARIMA Forecasting using SAS**
  Forecasting transportation patterns and variable temperatures using SAS to apply ARIMA models with seasonal differencing, log transformation, and residual diagnostics to forecast monthly temperature and transportation time series data, selecting models based on AIC/SBC and validating with autocorrelation checks and confidence intervals.

- **Image Denoising using Bayesian Analysis**
  A Bayesian image denoising project using Markov Random Fields, Gibbs Sampling, and Metropolis-Hastings. Replacing different sigma values from the proposed ones, from 0.01 to 1, to find the best sigmas for denoising the image.

- **PowerBI and Python Data Visualizations**
  Using Python and PowerBI to create serval data visualizations using multiple datasets. Implemented PowerBI functions such as DAX and Power Querying.

- **Python Machine Learning**
  The projects consist of methods using matplotlib and numpy libraries to create conditionals, loops and functions, plots, Monte Carlo simulation of random processes and for business applications, polynomial regression, k-means clustering, And Artificial Neural Networks.
